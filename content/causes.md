## My causes
*Last updated April 17 2025*

Inspired by my friend [Martins](https://mht.wtf/donate/) webpage, where he describes the causes and software he supports, I wanted to do something similar — but more broadly. I donate money, or have a membership, with the goal of helping the cause. I do this for causes I care about, but for various reasons cannot or won't take part in myself. The reason for publishing it here is to increase awareness and show support for those very causes.

Note: I support the cause or organization, but that doesn’t mean I agree with everything they do or say. I believe in free speech and open conversations — that’s often what leads to better, new solutions. For me, supporting something includes room for disagreement.

### Donations
I regularly donate money to (monthly, usually), and support the work of, the following organizations:

- **[Røde Kors](https://www.rodekors.no/):** Humanitarian relief and emergency aid globally. I donate because they provide crucial help in crisis areas and local communities.
    
- **[Amnesty International](https://amnesty.no/):** Protects human rights worldwide. I support their efforts for more freedom, justice, and dignity, and standing up for those 
    
- **[Gi Effektivt](https://gieffektivt.no/):** Promotes effective altruism, maximizing positive impact through donations. I donate here to ensure my contributions make a measurable difference.
    
- **[Regnskogfondet](https://www.regnskog.no/):** Works to preserve rainforests and indigenous rights. I donate because I care about biodiversity and protecting ecosystems.
    
- **[Fremtiden i Våre Hender](https://www.framtiden.no/):** Advocates sustainable consumption and responsible use of resources. I support their vision of an environmentally sustainable future.
    
- **[Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/):** Ensures free access to knowledge. I donate to support open information and education worldwide.
    
### Memberships
I am also a member of the following organizations, which converts to a yearly or monthly donation:

- **[MS-forbundet](https://www.ms.no/):** Supports people affected by Multiple Sclerosis. I'm a member to contribute to advocacy and awareness about MS, as my wife was diagnosed in 2024.
  
- **[Blindeforbundet](https://www.blindeforbundet.no/):** Works for the rights and quality of life of people with visual impairments. Visual impairment has played a significant role in my life — I was diagnosed with cataracts and underwent surgery when I was three years old. 
    
- **[Naturvernforbundet](https://naturvernforbundet.no/):** Protects nature and advocates for environmental conservation. 
    
- **[Human-Etisk Forbund](https://human.no/):** Promotes humanist values and secular ethics. I'm a member to support secularism and critical thinking.
    
- **[Noregs Mållag](https://www.nm.no/):** Promotes the use and preservation of Nynorsk, the second written form of Norwegian. I support linguistic diversity and cultural heritage, and love books written Nynorsk. That being said, I might be biased as most of my family comes form western Norway.
    
- **[Europabevegelsen](https://www.europabevegelsen.no/):** Promotes European cooperation and unity. I support international collaboration and European integration. I believe Norway and other European countries are better off together.
    
- **[DNT](https://www.dnt.no/):** Norwegian Trekking Association, maintaining trails and cabins. I use those cabins every summer, and find their efforts extraordinary. 
    
- **[Skiforeningen](https://www.skiforeningen.no/):** Promotes skiing and maintains ski trails around Oslo, which I enjoy a lot.
