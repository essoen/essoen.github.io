## Software I use
*Last updated April 17 2025* 

I've recently done a clean-up of licenses that I have, and thought about what software I use. Here's what I'm currently using and am subscribed to (and thereby support):  



| App                                     | Description                       | Usage/comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Firefox and DuckDuckGo                  | Web browsing and search           | Currently evaluating Kagi (subscription based search) as a replacement for DuckDuckGo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Obsidian                                | Notes                             | Local and markdown based. Their Sync service works really well across devices. Moved away from Notion for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Remarkable                              | Notes                             | Used with my Remarkable, which is mostly for quick capture and thinking. I send my notes to myself by email, or gather them from the app, and dump them into Obisidan                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Long term user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1Password                               | Password management               | Moved to 1Pass from Lastpass a few years ago. Usable, everything I could ask for in a password manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Notion                                  | Notes                             | Mostly used with my wife for collaborative notes about the home and such. A lot of kanban boards. We also use it at work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Proton Mail, Drive, VPN and SimpleLogin | E-mail, storage, VPN, email alias | Recently bought 2 years of Proton Duo (with my wife) to handle mail with a custom domain, and get some long-term storage. In addition, it feels good to support a privacy oriented ethos. Some limitations in usability but it works well enough. Great value.                                                                                               |
| Google Drive and Photos                 | Storage and photos                | Because of interoperability I use Google for everyday storage and collaboration, both privately and at work. It works well enough, but I'm trying to move to alternatives. The user experience of Google Photos in particular is fantastic, so it's been hard to find good alternatives that are credible and value privacy. I am currently evaluating Ente. |
