## Software I use
*Last updated April 30 2025* 

I've recently done a clean-up of licenses that I have, and thought about what software I use. Here's what I'm currently using and am subscribed to (and thereby support):  



| App                                     | Description                       | Usage/comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Productivity**                        |                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Firefox and Kagi                  | Web browsing and search           | Kagi is a search engine that values privacy by having no ads. It's supported with a subcription. Paying for search was a bit weird in the beginning, but after a while I was hooked. Their results are better and much less cluttered than DuckDuckGo, Brave and Google. Talking about Brave, I use their browser when I need a Chromium based one. Firefox for everything else. Love their extensions.   
| Obsidian                                | Notes                             | Local and markdown based. Their Sync service works really well across devices. Moved away from Notion for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Remarkable                              | Notes                             | Used with my Remarkable, which is mostly for quick capture and thinking. I send my notes to myself by email, or gather them from the app, and dump them into Obisidan                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Todoist                                 | Todo application                  | Fantastic application: Easy to use, highly customizeable and cheap. Long term user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1Password                               | Password management               | Moved to 1Pass from Lastpass a few years ago. Usable, everything I could ask for in a password manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ChatGPT                                 | AI assistant / text generation    | Mostly used to improve/save time on work email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Proton Mail, Drive, VPN and SimpleLogin | E-mail, storage, VPN, email alias | Recently bought 2 years of Proton Duo (with my wife) to handle mail with a custom domain, and get some long-term storage. In addition, it feels good to support a privacy oriented ethos. Some limitations in usability but it works well enough. Great value.                                                                                               |
| Ente                 | Photo storage                | Encrypted photo storage, with a user experience liking that of Google Photos but with on-device AI features for the moments/on this day thing. Easy to let others add photos to an album, without them having an account.  |
| **Content**                             |                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Only thing missing now is automated weight increased based on a set program, but it seems like they are continuously  developing it. Lifetime subscription.                                                                                           |
