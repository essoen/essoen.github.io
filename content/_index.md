I am Stein-Otto Svorst√∏l, an engineering manager, executive and coach with a passion for building high-performing teams and organizations. That usually means that my job is understanding the business, and coaching and developing all parts of the organization to deliver as much value as possible. Currently, I work as COO & consultant for [Capra Consulting](https://capraconsulting.no) in Oslo, Norway.

My most recent engagements have been building high-performing empowered teams that build infrastructure and network solutions (i.e. the IT platform) for both developers and media systems/teams at NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Service) and helping Airthings with Way of Working and OKRs. Currently, I am leading a product team at Vy (a Norwegian railway company) while developing new services internally in my consultancy. In addition, I am completing an Executive Master of Managet at BI this summer.

Outside work I enjoy hiking and other outdoorsy activities, reading books, listening to music, drinking gin and wine, and spending unproportionatel amounts of time researching novelty devices. I also have a dog called Doppler, named after both the [Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) and [Doppler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_(novel)). He's on [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/buhunden_doppler), for some reason.

I do have an interest in technology, and so I've written a bit about the software I use [here](/software). In addition, I also support a few causes I belive in. Either through donations or a membership. I've written a few words about those [here](/causes).

Sometimes I [think about things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU) and even write some thoughts down. Sometimes I publish those thoughts here on my [blog](/blog).
