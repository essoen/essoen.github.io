I am Stein-Otto Svorst√∏l, an engineering manager, executive and coach with a passion for building high-performing teams and organizations. That usually means that my job is understanding the business, and coaching and developing all parts of the organization to deliver as much value as possible. I hold a Masters degree in Computer Science from NTNU, and an Executive Master of Management from BI Norwegian Business School. Currently, I work as COO & consultant for [Capra Consulting](https://capraconsulting.no) in Oslo, Norway.

My most recent engagements have been building high-performing empowered teams that build infrastructure and network solutions (i.e. the IT platform) for both developers and media systems/teams at NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Service) and helping Airthings with Way of Working and OKRs. Currently, I am leading a product team at Vy (a Norwegian railway company) while developing new services internally in my consultancy. 

Outside work I enjoy hiking and other outdoorsy activities, reading books, listening to music, drinking gin and wine, and spending unproportionatel amounts of time researching novelty devices.

I do have an interest in technology, and so I've written a bit about the software I use [here](/software). In addition, I also support a few causes I belive in. Either through donations or a membership. I've written a few words about those [here](/causes).

Sometimes I [think about things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU) and even write some thoughts down. Sometimes I publish those thoughts here on my [blog](/blog).
