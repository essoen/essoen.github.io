I am Stein-Otto Svorstøl, an engineering manager, executive and coach with a passion for building high-performing teams and organizations. That means that my job is understanding the business, and coaching and developing all parts of the organization to deliver as much value as possible. Currently, I work as COO & consultant for [Capra Consulting](https://capraconsulting.no) in Oslo, Norway.

My most recent engagements have been building high-performing empowered teams that build infrastructure and network solutions (i.e. the IT platform) for both developers and media systems/teams at NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Service) and helping Airthings with Way of Working and OKRs. Currently, I am leading a product team at Vy (a Norwegian railway company) while developing new services internally in my consultancy. In addition, I am working on a master's degree in leadership at BI.

Outside work I enjoy hiking and other outdoorsy activities, reading books, listening to music, drinking gin and wine, and spending unproportional amounts of time researching novelty devices. I also have a called Doppler, named after both the [Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) and [Doppler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_(novel)). He's on [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/buhunden_doppler), for some reason.

Sometimes I [think about things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU) and even write some thoughts down. Sometimes I publish those thoughts here on my [blog](/blog).
