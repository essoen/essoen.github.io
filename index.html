That usually means that my job is understanding the business, and coaching and developing all parts of the organization to deliver as much value as possible. I hold a Masters degree in Computer Science from NTNU, and an Executive Master of Management from BI Norwegian Business School. Currently, I work as COO & consultant for <a href=https://capraconsulting.no>Capra Consulting</a> in Oslo, Norway.</p><p>My most recent engagements have been building high-performing empowered teams that build infrastructure and network solutions (i.e. the IT platform) for both developers and media systems/teams at NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Service) and helping Airthings with Way of Working and OKRs. Currently, I am leading a product team at Vy (a Norwegian railway company) while developing new services internally in my consultancy.</p><p>Outside work I enjoy hiking and other outdoorsy activities, reading books, listening to music, drinking gin and wine, and spending unproportionatel amounts of time researching novelty devices.</p><p>I do have an interest in technology, and so I&rsquo;ve written a bit about the software I use <a href=/software>here</a>. In addition, I also support a few causes I belive in. Either through donations or a membership. I&rsquo;ve written a few words about those <a href=/causes>here</a>.</p><p>Sometimes I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU">think about things</a> and even write some thoughts down. Sometimes I publish those thoughts here on my <a href=/blog>blog</a>.</p></main><footer><p>Subscribe to my blog with <a href=/index.xml>RSS</a></p><p><a href=mailto:stein-otto@svorstol.com>E-mail</a> |
