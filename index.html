My most recent engagements have been building high-performing empowered teams that build infrastructure and network solutions (i.e. the IT platform) for both developers and media systems/teams at NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Service) and helping Airthings with Way of Working and OKRs.

I also have a dog called Doppler, named after both the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect>Doppler effect</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_(novel)>Doppler</a>. He&rsquo;s on <a href=https://www.instagram.com/buhunden_doppler>Instragram</a>, for some reason.</p><p>I do have an interest in technology, and so I&rsquo;ve written a bit about the software I use <a href=/software>here</a>. In addition, I also support a few causes I belive in. Either through donations or a membership. I&rsquo;ve written a few words about those <a href=/causes>here</a>.</p><p>Sometimes I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU">think about things</a> and even write some thoughts down. Sometimes I publish those thoughts here on my <a href=/blog>blog</a>.</p></main><footer><p>Subscribe to my blog with <a href=/index.xml>RSS</a></p><p><a href=mailto:stein-otto@svorstol.com>E-mail</a> |
