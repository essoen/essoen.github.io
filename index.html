<a href=/blog>Blog</a></nav></header><main><p>I am Stein-Otto Svorstøl, an engineering manager, executive and coach with a passion for building high-performing teams and organizations. That means that my job is understanding the business, and coaching and developing all parts of the organization to deliver as much value as possible. Currently, I work as COO & consultant for <a href=https://capraconsulting.no>Capra Consulting</a> in Oslo, Norway.</p><p>My most recent engagements have been building high-performing empowered teams that build infrastructure and network solutions (i.e. the IT platform) for both developers and media systems/teams at NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Service) and helping Airthings with Way of Working and OKRs. Currently, I am leading a product team at Vy (a Norwegian railway company) while developing new services internally in my consultancy. In addition, I am working on a master&rsquo;s degree in leadership at BI.</p><p>Outside work I enjoy hiking and other outdoorsy activities, reading books, listening to music, drinking gin and wine, and spending unproportionatel amounts of time researching novelty devices. I also have a dog called Doppler, named after both the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect>Doppler effect</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_(novel)>Doppler</a>. He&rsquo;s on <a href=https://www.instagram.com/buhunden_doppler>Instragram</a>, for some reason.</p><p>Sometimes I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU">think about things</a> and even write some thoughts down. Sometimes I publish those thoughts here on my <a href=/blog>blog</a>.</p></main><footer>Subscribe to my blog by <a href=/index.xml>RSS</a><br><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/essoen/>Linkedin</a> |
