creating focus, tracking if initiatives to decide if they hit on desired
outcomes, as well as creating alignment in the organisation. Not only for new
initiatives, but across the business. By some, it seems to be looked at as a
silver bullet for tracking work. In my experience, OKRs are not suitable for
everyone and everything. Being clear on when and how you use them, is far more
important than being able to say that one uses them in marketing.</p><p>An example: A team who works on a specific feature, ordered by a customer the
year before, will of course struggle with defining the
<a href=https://www.whatmatters.com/series_entries/s1-3-how-to-write-good-okr>right</a>
Key Results. To them, the result is delivering the feature, a binary goal. The
desired outcome is not clear to them, and it’s not even clear if that initiative
is the only or the best one to deliver the outcome <em>someone</em> desires. The teams
I’ve worked in this context, feel that they’re trying to retrofit a model to thier
context, solving problems that they might not agree exsist.</p><p>Thankfully, I&rsquo;m not alone in seeintg this. Christina Wodtke who wrote the fantastic
book <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Focus-Achieving-Important-Objectives/dp/0996006028>Radical
Focus</a>,
recently wrote this
<a href=https://cwodtke.medium.com/not-everyone-needs-okrs-a198db0c7bc8>article</a> about
not everyone not needing OKRs. Where OKRs are great to track a <a href=https://medium.com/@meetfelipe/okr-vs-kpis-what-is-the-difference-ffa54673fcf1>desired change
in a
KPI</a>,
not all work will contribute to that change. HR paying out wages does not need
an OKR, it&rsquo;s just something that needs to get done. This is not only specific
for HR. Most business areas have some parts that just needs to get done. For
this OKRs are not the right tool. Wodtke calls this heartbeat work.</p><p>With this in mind, and as I’ve seen the same problem a few times, I’ve worked on
a model to explain how different metrics might fit together in a
well-established organization with various types of work that needs to get done.
It’s been useful to me; it might be useful to you too.</p><p><img src=/2022/okr-metric-model.jpg alt=Model></p><p>To add some explanation: The idea is that there are several levels of metrics,
and needs for metrics. The levels would be something like:</p><ol><li><p>The old school Key Performance Indicators shows what the business area or
whole organization values as important in terms of business performance.
What would be acceptable levels for each of them?</p></li><li><p>Then you define one or more Objectives, that is meant to change performance
in the KPI. You define several Key Results that might tell you if you’re on
the right track.</p></li><li><p>The OKRs might be broken down by other units/teams, so that they are more
meaningful to them</p></li><li><p>Finally, we define some initiatives, that is the actual work or output that
can contribute to desired outcomes.</p></li><li><p>In addition, teams with well-established responsibilities might also need to
track indicators that shows if the “heartbeat” work is on track. If your app
rating falls to the ground, that new feature might not matter. You’ll need
to refocus.</p></li></ol><p>Based on this, some teams might only work directly with OKRs, not even needing
any task management as the team is so small, and things are moving fast. Other
teams will have a few working directly to test hypotheses to move the needle on
an OKR, while others work on an initiative that was promised to another
department. I’ve found that it helps in building understanding, and in turn make OKRs useful,
by being aware of the differences and track them appropriately. OKR, like agile,
is not a silver bullet. We&rsquo;ll always need to tailor to context.</p></content><p><i>Any thoughts, comments or corrections after reading this post?<br>Please, do reach out by
