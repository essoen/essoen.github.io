One of the assignments was regarding how to use education and communication in an agile transition. One of the discussions sparked my interest, and I thought more about it after the course. This brought me to a model of how I&rsquo;d address the need for communication and education, that might be useful for others as well.</p><p>From <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Agile-Nothing-Business-Agility/dp/3903205397>Rethinking Agile</a> we have three levels in an organization [^1]:</p><ol><li>Operational Level, e.g. team level</li><li>Co-ordinational Level. e.g. heads of department or business area</li><li>Strategic Portfolio Management, e.g. C-level executives.</li></ol><p>In some organizations, these levels might have multiple layers.</p><p>Both education and communication has to be done at all these levels, and also between the levels. My take is that in a large scale agile transition, I&rsquo;d guess that education primarily would be used to give an idea of what the ideal state might look like. One cannot do educational activities, such as asking everyone to watch a set of videos, to give a common understanding of where one is at. For that, facilitated workshops, and all levels of the organization, must be put in place.</p><p>In practice, I am guessing it&rsquo;d look something like this:</p><ol><li>Various ways of two-way communication to assess where we are, which might be done through<ol><li>Facilitated workshops at all levels to identify desired outcomes, and assess current situation</li><li>Share desired outcomes at all levels, and findings, through townhalls, all hands meetings etc.</li></ol></li><li>Educate to make people see where to go, which might be done through<ol><li>Community of practice</li><li>Book clubs and reading lists</li><li>Sharing video material</li><li>Agile coaching</li></ol></li><li>Experiments to find out how to move forward</li></ol><p>This would bring us into a feedback loop between goals (education), and creating a common understanding of where we are. The relation between the two, is experiments, just like the general approach from <a href=https://simonpowers.medium.com/change-the-awa-playbook-by-simon-powers-2c08c481361c>Adventures With Agile Playbook</a>. The learning and education would soon also be brought into the discussions on the current situation, providing another arena for challenging and developing the agile mindset.</p><p>How would you balance communication and education in an agile transition? Does this relationship make sense?</p><p>[^1]: Examples of roles are my own, not directly from the book</p></content><hr><p style=text-align:right><a href="mailto:?subject=Re%3a%20Communication%20and%20Education%20in%20an%20Agile%20Transition">Reply to this post by email</a></p></main><footer><p>Subscribe to my blog with <a href=/index.xml>RSS</a></p><p><a href=mailto:stein-otto@svorstol.com>E-mail</a> |
