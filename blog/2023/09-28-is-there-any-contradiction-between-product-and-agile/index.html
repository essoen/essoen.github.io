I do not agree with the premise at all, and I&rsquo;ve thought about the relation.</p><p>Product is about what to build, i.e. something that hits a need. Agile is about delivering continously, and being able to respond to changes fast. It was a response to waterfall and plan-based development.</p><blockquote><p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan</p><p>That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
<em>From <a href=https://agilemanifesto.org/>The Agile Manifesto</a></em></p></blockquote><p>A company can be agile but not be product-minded. And a company can likewise be product-minded but not agile in how they deliver it.</p><p>To combine the two means</p><ol><li>Being organized for flow into product teams that have what they need to deliver, i.e. utilize tools such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design>Domain-Driven Design</a> and <a href=https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2021/02-14-team-top-at-capra/>Team Topologies</a></li><li>Have effective prioritzation that does not isolate Time-To-Market-calculations to development teams, but rather a organization wide effort. See <a href=https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2022/rethinking-agile/>Flight Levels and Rethinking Agile</a></li><li>Utilize tools such as <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Discovery-Habits-Discover-Products/dp/1736633309>Product Discovery Habits</a>, and develop product-market fit</li></ol><p>The product-mindset comes into play in the product teams. It can also happen in dedicated business development departments or teams, as long as those are viewed as a part of a complete value chain for the company.</p></content><hr><p style=text-align:right><a href="mailto:?subject=Re%3a%20Is%20there%20any%20contradiction%20between%20product%20and%20agile%3f">Reply to this post by email</a></p></main><footer><p>Subscribe to my blog with <a href=/index.xml>RSS</a></p><p><a href=mailto:stein-otto@svorstol.com>E-mail</a> |
