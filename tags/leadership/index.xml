Recently, Manuel Pais, co-author of <em>Team Topologies</em>, used my company as an example of something we’ve both called <strong>Leadership as a Platform</strong>. You can see us mentioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5SUWdrlTfs&amp;list=PLLwpyIL5FI9wahgmw324EAllojHvOqtb2&amp;t=1376s">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been deeply involved in shifting how we see ourselves—as a <strong>platform</strong>—and ensuring we maintain that perspective. Instead of treating leadership as a position or a set of management tasks, we emphasize that <strong>anyone</strong> can take leadership. It’s about stepping up, driving alignment, and enabling others to succeed.</p>
<p>To make this work, we’ve built a dedicated team focused on <strong>alignment and leadership as a platform</strong>—which we call <strong>Team Alignment</strong>. Their mission is to provide services that empower our teams and individuals to take the lead while keeping the organization aligned. They cover many of the tasks of a traditional top management group.</p>
<h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service-Oriented Leadership:</strong> We view leadership activities as <strong>services</strong>, not just tasks. This ensures that all necessary information is accessible and that teams are effectively onboarded into our strategic direction.</li>
<li><strong>Team Responsibility:</strong> Leadership and alignment are collective responsibilities rather than being solely on the shoulders of managers. This fosters a more collaborative and engaged environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach helps us maintain cohesive strategy, ensuring that everyone at Capra remains aligned and informed.</p>
