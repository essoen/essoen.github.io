We&rsquo;ve been blocked on deliveries, by either third parties or other teams. Blocked means being unable to move forward as desired. This could things such as some API or software someone else has to develop, or testing on some physical hardware that is not available.</p>
<p>Being blocked has forced us to reflect and evaluate our approach. Of course we  must maintain pressure on those we wait for. This can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>reach out regularly, and use tickler files to make sure we remember to do so</li>
<li>asking for timelines as a means to be able to time things for yourself</li>
<li>escalating to others internally, who talks with others with the third party</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s evident though that this work, even though necessary in many contexts, are not valuable it itself. It&rsquo;s waiting for someone else, and reminding/pushing them.</p>
<p>Our approach is to do those things, but mostly focus on what we can do of valuable work while we wait. What could that be?</p>
<ul>
<li>identify parts that can be built independent of the dependency, i.e. build a happy path first</li>
<li>handle the dependency by mocking or other techniques</li>
<li>prepare for things we know we&rsquo;ll have to do later.</li>
<li>move on to other things, without dependencies, and rework your goals and roadmap</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s an awareness thing. We all know we&rsquo;re blocked, but we can leverage the waiting time for something useful and valuable.</p>

There are many great ideas out there, but we cannot do them all at once. So, let&rsquo;s say you get a big request that your team does not have the bandwith to jump on. How do you respond?</p>
<p>What you don&rsquo;t want to do, is straight out say no. That&rsquo;s too hard, and won&rsquo;t come across as empathetic. We rather want to build a story about what we are building or doing , and how that might benefit the organization.  My first steps when asked to deliver on something, I usually do this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Show our goals</strong>: What are we currently trying to achieve.</li>
<li><strong>Show the roadmap:</strong> Here&rsquo;s our goals, and the activities layed out to fulfill those goals. Show what we&rsquo;re doing, and/or ask what they believe must be removed.</li>
<li><strong>Show what you&rsquo;ve delivered:</strong> I move goals and acitivites to a page where I note down when we delivered on it. I use it to show what we have spent our time on over the last months.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the beginning of a story around what we are aiming to do, and what we did to go there. Can the requester see their request fit into that story?</p>
<p>Last but not least, I show what can be done to improve the chances of being prioritised. In my experience, stakeholders are willing to invest more in your team or area, but they are unaware of the option. Showing that option, how they can help us get bandwidth to address their issue, is a great approach. But, I would not open with it. If you open with it, the response is usually something along the lines of &ldquo;but what about your current funding?&rdquo;</p>

I do not agree with the premise at all, and I&rsquo;ve thought about the relation.</p>
<p>Product is about what to build, i.e. something that hits a need. Agile is about delivering continously, and being able to respond to changes fast. It was a response to waterfall and plan-based development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan</p>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
<em>From <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">The Agile Manifesto</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A company can be agile but not be product-minded. And a company can likewise be product-minded but not agile in how they deliver it.</p>
<p>To combine the two means</p>
<ol>
<li>Being organized for flow into product teams that have what they need to deliver, i.e. utilize tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain-Driven Design</a> and <a href="https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2021/02-14-team-top-at-capra/">Team Topologies</a></li>
<li>Have effective prioritzation that does not isolate Time-To-Market-calculations to development teams, but rather a organization wide effort. See <a href="https://www.svorstol.com/blog/2022/rethinking-agile/">Flight Levels and Rethinking Agile</a></li>
<li>Utilize tools such as  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Discovery-Habits-Discover-Products/dp/1736633309">Product Discovery Habits</a>, and develop product-market fit</li>
</ol>
<p>The product-mindset comes into play in the product teams. It can also happen in dedicated business development departments or teams, as long as those are viewed as a part of a complete value chain for the company.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-the-problem">Part 1: The Problem</h2>
<p>The book takes a look at a company that goes through an Agile Transition. The IT organization had 600 people. The organization wants the transition for the usual reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Optimized Time to Market</li>
<li>Increase customer feedback</li>
<li>Become &ldquo;ready for the future&rdquo;, i.e. enable the IT organization to utilize new technology</li>
</ol>
<p>They plan their agile transition around the following practices, over a time frame of 18 months:</p>
<ol>
<li>All teams should be cross-functional</li>
<li>Every team should be organized around the premise &ldquo;one team, one product&rdquo;</li>
<li>There were the following minimum requirements for the agile process:
<ol>
<li>Work should be visually managed</li>
<li>Every team should have daily Standups and regular Retrospectives</li>
<li>They took the following measurements as reference points:
<ol>
<li>Throughout, i.e. the number of work items that are completed per time frame</li>
<li>Cycle time to indicate how fast work is completed</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The practices were implemented with training, reorganization through self-organization, and external support. Even though the mood was great and 80% of the teams had implemented the minimum requirements of practices, the measurements was not developing as expected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, the actual trend of the Scrum teams looked completely different. The teams managed to get off to a good start and velocity increased sharply. Then all of a sudden, the line flattened out and was now in a downward trend. The performance had strongly diminished over time.</p>
<p>[..]</p>
<p>As expected, the cycle time increased slightly at the beginning but only marginally decreased over time. The line followed a downward trend, but the improvement did not even reach the 1 percent mark—a cycle time reduced by half was nowhere to be found.<br>
Regardless, whether Scrum or Kanban—it was clear that ability of the teams to deliver had not changed much.</p>
<p>Leopold, Klaus. Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility (pp. 24-27). LEANability PRESS. Kindle Edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They did not have the measurements from before the transition, but they did have a measure of project cycle time. The project cycle time had gone down after the transition, which meant that the company went from bad to worse and did not meet its goals. Why?</p>
<h2 id="part-2-causes">Part 2: Causes</h2>
<p>The book describes four causes of the problem, each in its own section. He uses the example from the first part to explain these four causes. Here&rsquo;s a brief summary of each:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The pitfall of simplistic inference in the change process:</strong> The company wanted to optimize Time-To-Market (TTM) and faster customer feedback, and believes that agile is a concrete step to reach that goal. So they introduced a big agile transformation project. They reorganize, introduce new roles, and describe what these roles are allowed to do. This drew focus to roles, responsibilities, and processes, rather than how to actually increase TTM and customer feedback. They confuse <em>&ldquo;means for the purpose&rdquo;</em>. He also notes that your organizational model does not make you agile either. not. <em>&ldquo;Success depends on answering one question: How do we make our money and which problem are we trying to solve?&rdquo;</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Dealing with dependencies between Teams and Products:</strong> The teams had Kanban boards as required by the organization&rsquo;s chosen framework. In these boards, Leopold found columns that are called &ldquo;External waiting&rdquo;, i.e. the team has dependencies on other teams. He visualized this with a dependency graph. Dependencies lead to increased cycle times. The reason for this external wait time is, according to Leopold, that one forgets that: (1) Even though a team usually only works on one product, several teams are working on the same product. (2) Even though one team only works on one product, there are dependencies between products (3) Knowledge work has a tendency to create dependencies, and one has to be extremely cautious. He quotes Russel L. Ackoff <em>&quot;[..] the performance of the whole is never the sum of the parts taken separately, but it&rsquo;s the product of their interactions.&quot;</em>  Leopold ends with: <em>&ldquo;Agility is created when the interactions between teams are agile. That was the problem in this company: The interactions between the individual teams were not being managed.&rdquo;</em> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>An incomplete value stream:</strong> Many big and difficult steps ahead of the development, slows down development, such as idea selection, business case writeup, and steering committee approval. Leopold also observes that the burden of becoming faster falls on the development teams nevertheless. &ldquo;<em>And business agility will never be achieved if all of the slow-moving process and system logic is simply maintained without consideration for the end-to-end system.&rdquo;</em> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>WIP Limits at the wrong place:</strong> Leopold separates Work in Progress from Work in Process. In Progress means it&rsquo;s actively worked on, while In Process means that it&rsquo;s in the system but without real progress. To increase the organization&rsquo;s ability to deliver, the Flow Efficiency (how much time a work item spends in being actively worked on vs. in process), must reduce how much things are ongoing at the same time rather than the active work. To increase this, <strong>one must reduce the number of initiatives going at the same time</strong>, so that the most important initiatives are in <em>progress</em>, and tasks do not have to wait.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Addition in September 2023:</strong> The <a href="https://www.flightlevels.io/workshops/flight-levels-introduction/">Fligt Levels Academy Introduction</a> summarizes the causes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>No agile interactions</li>
<li>No end to end flow (of work)</li>
<li>No agile portfolio management</li>
<li>No agile change process</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part-3-flight-levels">Part 3: Flight Levels</h2>
<p>To enact the WIP limits for initiatives, and increase the project visibility and coordination to mitigate the problem and causes, the organization and establish artifacts and meetings at three levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Operational Level, i.e. implementation level:</strong> This is where the transition had focused so far, having a Kanban board and meetings within the team. The focus is on breaking down initiatives into tasks and delivering them.</li>
<li><strong>Co-ordinational Level:</strong> To optimize team interactions so that the prioritised initiatives are completed. The focus is to break the initiatives into pieces so that they can be worked on by teams, and to make sure that dependencies are handled.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Portfolio Management Level:</strong> Here you want an overview of everything that&rsquo;s happening, how it&rsquo;s going, and what to do next. Does the organization complete the initiatives, and are they aligned with the current company strategy? The focus is to set direction and prioritize.</li>
</ol>
<p>Start your transition at the highest possible flight level In this organization, that was at level 2. Lead by example.</p>
<h3 id="make-dependencies-visible-and-manage-them">Make dependencies visible and manage them</h3>
<p>At each level, you&rsquo;ll want a board that shows what&rsquo;s going on, and relevant people involved in relevant and well-organized meetings. Given that we already have the team-level boards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send team delegates to set up product boards (can be used by individual teams as well)</li>
<li>Define the optimal amount of work for the product/set of teams</li>
<li>Run product standup meetings with team delegates (could be in rotation)</li>
<li>Run replenishment meetings across teams when stuff is actually done</li>
<li>Establish feedback loops across teams, such as having cross-team retros</li>
<li>Get metrics for your feedback loops</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Too many meetings?</strong> We might not need all the old meetings, and everyone does not need to participate in everything.</p>
<h3 id="integrate-the-upstream">Integrate the upstream</h3>
<p>The upstream is the number of steps from the idea to when the developers can start working on that idea. If the steps take a lot of time, TTM is higher than necessary. We want to integrate the steps, processes, and people in the flight level system to increase TTM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question isn&rsquo;t how many steps are part of the upstream value stream, but instead how quickly these steps—from the first step to an assessable unit of value (idea, concept, etc.)—are able to be executed. - <em>Leopold, Klaus. Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility (p. 119). LEANability PRESS. Kindle Edition.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leopold describes three time traps in the upstream processes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The annual budget created batch sizes that were too large, i.e. what&rsquo;s committed in the budget is more than the teams can deliver. If what&rsquo;s to be built is decided a year ahead, agility is not pssobløe The longer one collects ideas, the lower the possibility of agility. To increase reaction time to market needs, you need a new budgeting process. Leopold suggests a monthly review and possible replenishment of money.</li>
<li>Colleagues as suppliers, i.e. if the IT department is considered a supplier that limits the possibility of a positive relationship. This means that we do not have one large process of estimates and approvals like you would see with an external contractor.</li>
<li>Making an estimate for something that must be done anyway, i.e. doing estimates for things that the company is legally bound to do anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Leopold&rsquo;s example they changed the upstream process to have the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Approx. business case</li>
<li>Waiting on approval</li>
<li>Reviewing business cases every two weeks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meeting more often for reviewing business cases made the development and business work tighter together. This was also supported by feedback loops:</p>
<ol>
<li>Joint standup meetings and retros</li>
<li>Metrics that would give an idea of the total of TTM, not just for development</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="strategic-portfolio-management">Strategic Portfolio Management</h3>
<p>Get the executive management on board so that strategy, operations, development, and delivery can work closely together towards a clearly defined goal. This means establishing flight level 3. Leopold recommends the same steps for including upper executive management as for the two other levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visualize
<ol>
<li>.. by making a strategy board that visualizes everything that&rsquo;s going on, and what&rsquo;s planned. Make one that fits your context. In Leopold&rsquo;s example, they idenfited two types of work with upper management: initiatives (makes money), and investments (&ldquo;necessary but not urgent projects&rdquo;). To focus on outcomes and ensure continuous evaluation, there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;finished&rdquo; column but &ldquo;Measuer &amp; Improve success&rdquo;, &ldquo;Adjust &amp; Improve&rdquo;, &ldquo;Result Achieved&rdquo; and &ldquo;Result not achieved&rdquo;.</li>
<li>.. by making the processes and criteria from idea to implementation explicit</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Limit the WIP. Find the right WIP limit for your organization.</li>
<li>Establish feedback loops by making sure there&rsquo;s a meeting around the board often enough, and that decision are actually made. Leopold recommends doing a Strategic Portfolio Standup weekly.  Also, run retros and strategy reviews. He recommends running these more often in the beginning and getting a sense of the necessary cadence over time.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The specific design of these steps can, must and should look different for every company. And the design can change over time based on the needs of the company and its customers. - <em>Leopold, Klaus. Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility (p. 131). LEANability PRESS. Kindle Edition.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="part-4-the-result">Part 4: The Result</h2>
<p>It all ends well, and the organization that&rsquo;s described has the following results:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced time to market</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strategic alignment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Greater efficiency</strong></li>
<li><strong>Focus on outcome over output</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased financials:</strong> Increased revenue. Also found that increased time to marked saved &ldquo;ten Million Euros per year in delay costs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How can we do the same?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Agility begins with the change process&rdquo;, so be an ambassador for agile ideas. Agility does not happen through a two-year plan, but through getting people on board and implementing practices. Lead by example.</li>
<li>Focus on goal over method</li>
<li>Focus on organizational process and generating value, rather than on the &ldquo;agile team&rdquo;</li>
<li>Identify flight levels, and get them on board. We won&rsquo;t get the &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; further than the management level we have involved</li>
<li>Manage and eliminate dependencies (not the other way around)</li>
<li>Implement the drivers for lean business at every flight level, that is:
<ol>
<li>Make work and processes explicit, i.e. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Work-Visible-Exposing-Optimize/dp/1942788150">Making Work Visible</a></li>
<li>Manage WIP</li>
<li>Increase feedback loops</li>
<li>Improve, i.e. use your feedback loops and implement improvements</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2>
<p>This was a great summary of both a typical agile transformation, and the causes of why it fails, and it introduces a concrete tool for how to handle organizational visualization of strategy, dependencies, and ongoing initiatives. It fits well with books such as Accelerate, Making Work Visible, Team Topologies,  The Fearless organization, Upstream, and A Seat at the Table.</p>
<p>These quotes stuck with me, but didn&rsquo;t fit directly into the summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business agility is achieved when delivering value to the customer is optimized. Sooner or later, it becomes clear what needs to change in the organizational structure to support this. <em>- Leopold, Klaus. Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility (p. 102). LEANability PRESS. Kindle Edition.</em></p>
<p>Business agility doesn&rsquo;t work if an organization is comprised of agile islands while the logic of the surrounding processes remains the same and certain groups exempt themselves from practicing agility. <em>- Leopold, Klaus. Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility (p. 126). LEANability PRESS. Kindle Edition.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision to &ldquo;work without a hierarchy&rdquo; has to be decided by someone—presumably it isn&rsquo;t the building maintenance person making this decision. <em>- Leopold, Klaus. Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility (p. 126). LEANability PRESS. Kindle Edition.</em></p>
<p>Important meetings should be held frequently People in organizations like to complain about meetings, which is partly due to how they are set up. But I also take a close look at how often important meetings are actually held. Most likely, you will find that the meeting intervals are too long (also making the meetings longer). The decisions made in these meetings lose value because people are forced to make permanent (isolated) decisions in the meantime. - <em>Leopold, Klaus. Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility (p. 136). LEANability PRESS. Kindle Edition.</em></p>

<p>In some organizations, these levels might have multiple layers.</p>
<p>Both education and communication has to be done at all these levels, and also between the  levels. My take is that in a large scale agile transition, I&rsquo;d guess that education primarily would be used to give an idea of what the ideal state might look like. One cannot do educational activities, such as asking everyone to watch a set of videos, to give a common understanding of where one is at. For that, facilitated workshops, and all levels of the organization, must be put in place.</p>
<p>In practice, I am guessing it&rsquo;d look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Various ways of two-way communication to assess where we are, which might be done through
<ol>
<li>Facilitated workshops at all levels to identify desired outcomes, and assess current situation</li>
<li>Share desired outcomes at all levels, and findings, through townhalls, all hands meetings etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Educate to make people see where to go, which might be done through
<ol>
<li>Community of practice</li>
<li>Book clubs and reading lists</li>
<li>Sharing video material</li>
<li>Agile coaching</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Experiments to find out how to move forward</li>
</ol>
<p>This would bring us into a feedback loop between goals (education), and creating a common understanding of where we are. The relation between the two, is experiments, just like the general approach from  <a href="https://simonpowers.medium.com/change-the-awa-playbook-by-simon-powers-2c08c481361c">Adventures With Agile Playbook</a>. The learning and education would soon also be brought into the discussions on the current situation, providing another arena for challenging and developing the agile mindset.</p>
<p>How would you balance communication and education in an agile transition? Does this relationship make sense?</p>

It has been hard, but it is now quite widely accepted that smaller iterations and getting user feedback fast, is crucial to building software that covers actual needs. This means better software, and better products. This trend means that we are starting to recognize that both product and software development are in of itself are complex problems <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, where the solution will be emerging over time. It cannot be defined up front. It will also be improved over time, through discovery. This means that it actually not a about the product, nor the software. It is not about business, or earning money. It is about solving complex problems, and doing it faster than anyone else. How?</p>
<h3 id="what-enables-us-to-solve-complex-problems">What enables us to solve complex problems?</h3>
<p>To build &ldquo;business agility&rdquo;, I argue that one must build an organizations capability to solve problems, more importantly complex ones. Most problems will be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most situations and decisions in organizations are complex because some major change — a bad quarter, a shift in management, a merger or acquisition—introduces unpredictability and flux. In this domain, we can understand why things happen only in retrospect. (Snowden and Boone, <a href="https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making">here</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snowden and Boone writes about this type of problems to address how a leader might approach them. As autonomy increases, more decisions are done everywhere in the organization. I.e. more problems are solved further &ldquo;down&rdquo; in the hierarchy. How does not one approach such problems, and make the solution as good as it can? An example approach can be found <a href="https://txm.com/making-sense-problems-cynefin-framework/">here</a>. It reads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explore to learn about the problem, as they require more creativity and innovative thinking skills</li>
<li>Develop a theory and experiment to gather more knowledge</li>
<li>Experimentation to discover patterns and gain more knowledge</li>
<li>Repeat as necessary, with the goal of moving your problem into another category</li>
<li>Execute and evaluate, following the Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle</li>
</ol>
<p>The premise here is that you ar e able to explore the problem thinking cratlively about it. You must develop theories and experiment. How might an organizatino best enable all teams to do those things?</p>
<h3 id="real-cross-functional-teams">Real Cross-Functional Teams</h3>
<p>What is capabilities does a team need to solve a complex problem?</p>
<ol>
<li>First, be able to see all parts of the problem they are trying to solve</li>
<li>Second, see many possible experiments that might shed light on the prolem and the solution they might find</li>
<li>Third, be able to act upon experiemnt, and roll out new changes</li>
</ol>
<p>Most teams, either in software development or otherwise, address one capabilitiy.
A software delivery team <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> rolls out changes, while a business/strategy team is trying to see the whole of a high level problem.</p>
<p>To adress all three,  the cross-functional cannot be cross-functional in the sense that it knows about devops, frontend/backend, infrastructure or even designing a UX. They must be capable of things like</p>
<ol>
<li>Developing the product, including building the tech and UX, and data pipelines to improve it</li>
<li>Developing the product strategy, including selecting the next feature to build, users to build for, how to spend time and not spent time</li>
<li>And building the market strategy</li>
<li>.. And propably many other things that I with my background cannot even think of. And that is sort of my point.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bring-in-people-iterate-over-the-whole-problem">Bring in people, iterate over the whole problem</h3>
<p>The recipe for building business agility seems to be the same as for building software agility. One could even argue that they are the exact same thing. And, it seems clear that the path to making value faster, is through solving the complex problems faster. This is, in turn, making sure that one has knowledge in the team that can adress the whole problem.</p>
<p>We need to stop placing &ldquo;a representative for the business&rdquo; as a Product Owner in the development team. This goes for design, UX and marketing as well, and all the other areas we miss. Creating flow is making sure our problems are solved fast, and the problems are about more than software. Building organizations without silos is hard. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Can we come together, and try harder?</p>
